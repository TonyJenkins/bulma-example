# bulma-example

A simple example of using the Bulma CSS Framework.

A very simple page, showing how to incorporate Bulma into a project. All the styling is done in Bulma, apart from a couple of colour and font changes, done in local CSS.

Icons are from Font Awesome, and hosted within the project.
